I'm a newish software developer, seeking a job in or around London. Until recently I worked in academic publishing. Having then consulted with an unorthodox ethical careers organisation called 80,000 Hours, I decided to pursue their [earning to give](https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/) strategy. I retrained at Makers Academy, and have been working as a developer since then, mostly with Ruby, but with an ever-increasing interest in complementing it with other tech.

Specifically I've been working on their [main website](http://www.agileventures.org). |
