I'm a newish software developer, seeking a job in London. Until recently I worked in academic publishing - but retrained at Makers Academy, partly from a desire for more challenge and innovation, partly due to some [unusual ethical careers advice](https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/). I've been working as a developer for approx 1.5 years, mostly with Ruby, but with an ever-increasing interest in complementing it with other tech.
