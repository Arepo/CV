I'm a junior level software developer, seeking a job in or around London or Oxford. Until recently I worked in academic publishing with little sense of direction, but having consulted and been directly involved with an unorthodox ethical careers organisation called 80,000 Hours, I decided to pursue their [earning to give](https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/) strategy. Consequently I'm keen to become the best coder I can be, as quickly as I can become it. [Read my code](https://github.com/Arepo) on GitHub.
